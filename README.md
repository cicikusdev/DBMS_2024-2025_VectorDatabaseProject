Ford Otosan - AI-Powered Production Data Management System

Project Overview

This project was developed for Ford Otosan to enhance their production line data management system. 
The company faced challenges due to unstructured, inconsistent, and error-prone data entries, 
which negatively impacted their chatbot’s ability to retrieve accurate information. 
To solve these issues, our team designed a solution that:

- Migrates the existing database to a vector database for optimized search capabilities.
- Performs extensive data cleaning, categorization, and structuring to eliminate inconsistencies.
- Implements a semantic search mechanism with cosine similarity to improve query accuracy.
- Develops an AI chatbot using Gemini LLM, enabling smarter and context-aware responses.

Key Features

🔹 Advanced Data Cleaning & Structuring
    -> Standardized inconsistent entries to improve search accuracy.
    -> Removed redundant, incomplete, and erroneous data.
    -> Categorized and restructured the database for optimized retrieval.
🔹 Vector Database Implementation
    -> Converted unstructured text data into high-dimensional vectors for fast and precise retrieval.
    -> Used ChromaDB for efficient vector-based search.
🔹 Semantic Search & Cosine Similarity
    -> Enabled meaning-based queries rather than strict keyword matching.
    -> Enhanced accuracy by comparing similarity scores between queries and stored data.
🔹 AI Chatbot Integration
    -> Utilized Gemini LLM for intelligent, context-aware responses.
    -> Provided dynamic answers based on vectorized database information.
🔹 Google OAuth Authentication
    -> Implemented secure login via Google accounts for user authentication.
🔹 Data Privacy Compliance
    -> No personally identifiable information (PII) is stored or processed.
    -> The system adheres to KVKK/GDPR regulations by working only with structured business data.

Technologies Used

🔹 Vector Database: ChromaDB
🔹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Python, Pandas, Regex
🔹 Semantic Search & Cosine Similarity: Sentence Transformers, Scikit-learn
🔹 LLM Integration: Gemini API
🔹 Backend Development: Flask, FastAPI

Results & Impact
This project significantly improved data reliability, search accuracy, and chatbot efficiency, 
reducing response errors and enhancing user experience. 
By integrating AI-powered search and structured data management, we created a more intelligent, 
fast, and effective production data system for Ford Otosan.
